# Armed Exterminators - Linking Strategy Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### Problem Solved
The website had a linking issue where:
1. Homepage service cards linked to the wrong URLs
2. All service links defaulted to Pasadena-specific pages
3. No way for users to choose their city when clicking services
4. Visitors from other cities were confused by Pasadena-centric content

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Service Hub Pages
Updated all main service pages to be city-selection hubs:
- `/services/rodent-control/` - Choose your city for rodent control
- `/services/ant-control/` - Choose your city for ant control  
- `/services/cockroach-exterminator/` - Choose your city for roach control
- `/services/spider-control/` - Choose your city for spider control
- `/services/bed-bug-treatment/` - Choose your city for bed bug treatment
- `/services/flea-treatment/` - Choose your city for flea treatment
- `/services/wasp-bee-removal/` - Choose your city for wasp/bee removal
- `/wildlife-control-services/` - Choose your city for wildlife removal

#### 2. Fixed Homepage Links
- Updated homepage to link to service hub pages instead of Pasadena-specific pages
- Now visitors can choose their city after clicking a service

#### 3. Updated Service Sidebar
- Changed sidebar links to point to hub pages
- This prevents defaulting to Pasadena when navigating between services

#### 4. Improved Main Services Page
- `/services/` now clearly shows all pest problems
- Links to appropriate hub pages
- Includes quick city links for popular services

## How It Works Now

### User Flow Example:
1. Visitor from San Marino lands on homepage
2. Clicks "Rodent Control" → Goes to `/services/rodent-control/`
3. Sees all cities listed with descriptions
4. Clicks "San Marino" → Goes to San Marino-specific page
5. Sidebar shows other services that link to hub pages
6. Can easily navigate to other services for their city

### Benefits:
- No more confusion about location-specific content
- Better user experience for non-Pasadena visitors
- Maintains SEO value of location-specific pages
- Easier navigation between services
- Scalable for adding new cities

## Technical Implementation

### Hub Page Structure:
Each service hub page includes:
- General service information
- City grid with descriptions
- Links to all city-specific pages
- Common problems and solutions
- FAQ section
- Call to action

### City-Specific Pages:
Remain unchanged but now properly linked from hub pages
- Keep their local SEO value
- Maintain specific content
- Cross-link to related services in same city

## Next Steps

1. **Test all links** to ensure they work correctly
2. **Monitor user behavior** to see if navigation improves
3. **Consider dynamic location detection** to suggest nearest city
4. **Add breadcrumbs** to show users their navigation path
5. **Create more city-specific pages** for services that don't have them yet

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Smart Location Detection
- Use IP geolocation to suggest nearest service area
- "Looks like you're in Arcadia - see our Arcadia services"
- Still allow manual city selection

### 2. Service Package Pages
- Create bundled service pages by city
- Example: "Complete Pest Control in Monrovia"
- Cross-sell multiple services

### 3. Neighborhood-Specific Pages
- Drill down from city to neighborhood
- Example: "Rodent Control in Old Town Pasadena"
- Target hyper-local searches

### 4. Seasonal Service Hubs
- "Spring Pest Control" with city selection
- "Holiday Wildlife Prevention" by location
- Time-sensitive local content

1. `/themes/armed-neon/layouts/index.html` - Fixed homepage service links
