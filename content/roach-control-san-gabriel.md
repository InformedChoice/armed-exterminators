## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you eliminate roaches without closing our restaurant?
Yes, we specialize in working around restaurant operations. We use targeted treatments during off-hours and in non-food areas during service. Most treatments don't require any closure.

### Do you provide documentation for health inspections?
Absolutely. We provide detailed service reports, treatment records, and pest sighting logs that meet all health department requirements. We can also provide emergency documentation if needed.

### How fast can you respond to a roach emergency?
For San Gabriel businesses, we offer same-day emergency service. If you call before 2 PM, we can usually have a technician on-site within 3-4 hours.

### Why are German roaches so hard to eliminate?
German roaches reproduce incredibly fast and have developed resistance to many pesticides. Our rotating treatment protocol and growth regulators overcome this resistance for complete elimination.

Yes, we have bilingual technicians who speak Spanish and Mandarin, important for San Gabriel's diverse business community.
