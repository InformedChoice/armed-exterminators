## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you treat ants in restaurant kitchens?
We use food-safe gel baits placed in cracks away from food surfaces, combined with exterior perimeter treatments. All methods meet health department requirements for food service establishments.

### Can ants spread between businesses in strip malls?
Yes, ants travel through shared walls, electrical conduits, and plumbing. We coordinate treatments between adjacent units when possible for best results.

### Do you offer after-hours service for businesses?
Absolutely. We understand businesses can't always close for pest control. We offer early morning, evening, and weekend appointments to minimize disruption.

### Why do ants get worse after rain in San Gabriel?
Rain floods underground nests, driving ants indoors. San Gabriel's clay soil and urban drainage make this especially problematic. Pre-rain treatment prevents invasions.

### Is monthly service really necessary for restaurants?
For San Gabriel food businesses, yes. The combination of food odors, grease, moisture, and high traffic requires consistent prevention to avoid health code violations.
