## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it legal to trap and relocate wildlife?
California law has specific regulations about wildlife handling. We're licensed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife and follow all state guidelines for humane removal and relocation.

### What if there are babies in my attic?
We never separate mothers from dependent young. We use exclusion methods that allow the family to leave together, or wait until babies are mobile before beginning removal.

### How can I prevent wildlife problems?
Prevention is key: secure food sources, maintain your property, and seal potential entry points. We provide detailed prevention plans specific to your property's vulnerabilities.
