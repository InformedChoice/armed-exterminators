## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is wildlife removal legal?
Yes, when performed by licensed professionals. We hold all required state permits and follow California Fish & Wildlife regulations for humane trapping and relocation.

We never separate mothers from babies. We use exclusion methods that keep families together or wait until young are mobile. This is both humane and legally required.

### Do you kill the animals?
No. We use humane removal methods including one-way doors, live trapping, and eviction techniques. Animals are relocated following state guidelines.

### How much does wildlife removal cost?
Costs vary by species, location, and extent of problem. Most services range from $295-$795. We provide free inspections and written quotes.
