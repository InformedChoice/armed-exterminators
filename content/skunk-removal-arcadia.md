## Frequently Asked Questions

### When are skunks most active in Arcadia?
Skunks are nocturnal and most active from dusk to dawn. In Arcadia, they're particularly active February through October, with peak activity during mating season (February-March) and when raising young (April-June).

### Why is my lawn full of holes?
Skunks dig cone-shaped holes while hunting for grubs, their favorite food. Arcadia's well-irrigated lawns support large grub populations. Professional lawn treatment combined with skunk removal provides the best solution.

### Can skunks spray more than once?
Yes, skunks can spray 5-6 times in succession, though they prefer to conserve their spray. They'll give warning signs first: stamping feet, raising tail, and turning their back to threats.

### Do mothballs or ammonia repel skunks?
These home remedies rarely work and may be illegal to use outdoors in California. Skunks quickly adapt to smells. Professional exclusion and removal provide permanent solutions.

### What if a skunk sprays my pet?
Keep pets outside initially. Mix 1 quart hydrogen peroxide, 1/4 cup baking soda, and 1 teaspoon dish soap. Apply immediately, avoiding eyes. Rinse thoroughly. We can recommend professional pet groomers experienced with skunk odor.
