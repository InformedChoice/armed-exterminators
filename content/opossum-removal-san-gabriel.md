## Frequently Asked Questions

### When are opossums most active?
Opossums are nocturnal, most active between dusk and dawn. In San Gabriel, they're particularly active during spring breeding season and fall when preparing for winter. Daytime activity often indicates illness.

### Can opossums damage my home's foundation?
While opossums don't typically damage foundations directly, their burrowing under structures can cause erosion and create moisture problems. Their presence often indicates existing foundation gaps that need sealing.

### What's attracting opossums to my property?
Common attractants include pet food, fallen fruit, open garbage, compost piles, and water sources. San Gabriel's many fruit trees and gardens make properties especially attractive to foraging opossums.

### Should I use repellents?
Commercial repellents rarely provide lasting results. Opossums quickly adapt or simply avoid treated areas while still living on your property. Professional exclusion is more effective long-term.

### How many opossums might I have?
Opossums are generally solitary except when mating or raising young. However, good habitat can attract multiple individuals. One opossum often indicates conditions that will attract others.
