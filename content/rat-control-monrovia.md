## Frequently Asked Questions

### How are Monrovia's rat problems different from other cities?
Monrovia's foothill location means rats often come from wilderness areas rather than neighboring properties. Canyon winds and seasonal changes drive more dramatic population shifts than in valley cities.

### Do foothill homes need different rat control methods?
Yes. We use elevated bait stations to prevent non-target wildlife exposure and focus heavily on exclusion since rats continuously migrate from canyon areas. Treatment plans account for Monrovia's unique topography.

### When is rat season worst in Monrovia?
Late fall through winter, when cold canyon winds drive rats to seek warm shelter. Spring also sees increased activity as rats feed on ripening avocados and citrus fruit abundant in Monrovia yards.

### Why are roof rats so common in Old Town Monrovia?
The combination of historic homes with original wood construction, mature fruit trees, and established ivy or vegetation creates perfect roof rat habitat. These rats excel at climbing and love Monrovia's tree canopy.

### How much does rat exclusion cost for foothill homes?
Monrovia's foothill properties typically require more extensive exclusion work, ranging from $895 to $1,595. Canyon-facing homes may need additional fortification. We provide free inspections to assess your specific needs.
