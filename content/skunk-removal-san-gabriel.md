## Frequently Asked Questions

### What time of year are skunks most problematic?
In San Gabriel, skunks are active year-round but cause most problems February through September. Mating season (February-March) and kit-rearing (April-June) see increased activity and territorial behavior.

### How do I know if skunks are living under my house?
Look for burrow entrances (4-6 inches wide), smell musky odors even without spraying, notice increased insect activity (skunks disturb insect populations), and listen for shuffling sounds at night.

### Will skunks leave on their own?
Once established, skunks rarely leave good habitat voluntarily. San Gabriel's year-round mild weather and abundant food mean skunks will stay and multiply without professional intervention.

### What diseases do skunks carry?
Skunks are primary rabies vectors in California. They also carry distemper, leptospirosis, and various parasites. This is why professional handling with proper safety equipment is essential.

### How can I skunk-proof my property?
Start with professional grub control for your lawn, secure all potential den sites, remove food sources, and install proper barriers. We provide comprehensive prevention plans tailored to San Gabriel properties.
