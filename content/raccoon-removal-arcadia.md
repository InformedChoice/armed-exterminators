## Frequently Asked Questions

### When are raccoons most active in Arcadia?
Raccoons are nocturnal and most active from dusk to dawn. In Arcadia, they're especially active during fruit season and when young are being raised (March-August).

### Will raccoons attack my pets?
Raccoons generally avoid confrontation but will defend themselves and their young. Keep pets indoors at night, especially during breeding season. Raccoons can seriously injure cats and small dogs.

### Why did raccoons choose my Arcadia property?
Arcadia properties often have everything raccoons want: water (pools, ponds), food (pet food, fruit trees, koi), and shelter (large attics, pool houses). Your property likely offers all three.

### Is it legal to trap raccoons myself?
California law requires proper licensing for trapping and relocating wildlife. DIY attempts often separate mothers from babies or relocate animals improperly. Professional service ensures humane, legal removal.

### How can I protect my koi pond?
Install motion-activated sprinklers, use pond netting at night, create steep sides raccoons can't wade in, and consider electric fencing. Many Arcadia estates successfully combine these methods.
