## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are opossums dangerous to pets or children?
Opossums are generally docile and prefer to flee or "play dead." However, they will defend themselves if cornered. Keep pets supervised at night and teach children never to approach wildlife.

### Do opossums really "play dead"?
Yes, this involuntary response (thanatosis) happens when extremely frightened. They become catatonic, emit a foul odor, and appear dead for up to 4 hours. Never assume an opossum is actually dead.

### What attracts opossums to my property?
Pet food, fallen fruit, open compost, accessible garbage, and water sources. They also seek shelter under decks, in sheds, or in crawl spaces, especially when raising young.

### Is it legal to trap opossums myself?
California law requires proper permits for trapping and relocating wildlife. Improper handling can spread disease and cause unnecessary suffering. Professional removal ensures legal compliance.

### How can I tell if it's an opossum or raccoon?
Opossums have white faces, naked tails, and move slowly. Raccoons have masked faces, ringed tails, and are more agile. Opossums also leave different tracks and droppings.
