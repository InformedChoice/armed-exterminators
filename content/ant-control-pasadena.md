## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are Argentine ants so bad in Pasadena?
Pasadena's urban environment is perfect for Argentine ant super-colonies. Our year-round irrigation, mild climate, and dense housing allow colonies to grow massive and span entire neighborhoods.

### Can you treat just my apartment for ants?
While we can treat individual units, ants often travel between apartments through walls and plumbing. We recommend coordinating with neighbors or property management for best results.

### How long does ant control take in older Pasadena homes?
Craftsman and historic homes typically need 2-3 treatments due to multiple entry points and original wood construction. Complete control usually occurs within 14-21 days.

### Why do ants get worse after it rains in Pasadena?
Rain floods underground nests, driving ants indoors. Pasadena's clay soil doesn't drain well, making this problem worse. Pre-rain treatment prevents these invasions.

### Is ant treatment safe for my pets?
Yes, we use pet-safe products and application methods. Baits are placed in areas pets can't access, and we use non-toxic barriers when possible.
