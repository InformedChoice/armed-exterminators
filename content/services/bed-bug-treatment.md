## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does bed bug treatment cost?
Treatment costs vary by method and infestation size. Chemical treatments typically range from $500-$1,500 per unit. Heat treatments are more but often need just one visit. We provide free inspections and written quotes.

### Which treatment method is best?
Both methods work when properly applied. Chemical is more affordable but requires multiple visits. Heat is faster but costs more. Severe infestations often benefit from integrated approach. We'll recommend the best option for your situation.

### Can I treat bed bugs myself?
DIY rarely succeeds with bed bugs. They hide too well and have developed resistance to retail products. Professional treatment saves money long-term by ensuring complete elimination the first time.

### Will bed bugs come back?
With proper treatment and prevention, bed bugs don't return on their own. Re-infestation only occurs from new introduction. We provide warranties and teach prevention to keep you bed bug free.
