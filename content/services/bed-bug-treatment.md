## Understanding Bed Bugs

### What Are Bed Bugs?
Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) are small, parasitic insects that feed exclusively on blood:
- **Size**: Adult bed bugs are 4-5mm (apple seed sized)
- **Color**: Reddish-brown, darker and swollen after feeding
- **Shape**: Flat, oval body that swells when fed
- **Movement**: Cannot fly or jump, but crawl quickly
- **Lifespan**: Can live 6-12 months, surviving months without feeding

### How Do Bed Bug Infestations Start?
**Bed bugs are NOT a sign of poor hygiene**. They affect all economic levels and property types:

- **Travel**: #1 source - hotels, motels, Airbnbs, luggage
- **Visitors**: Guests unknowingly bring them in bags/clothing
- **Used Items**: Furniture, clothing, electronics from others
- **Adjacent Units**: Spread through apartments/condos
- **Public Spaces**: Theaters, public transit, offices, schools

### Signs of Bed Bug Infestation
- **Bites**: Red, itchy welts often in lines or clusters
- **Blood Stains**: Small rust-colored spots on sheets
- **Fecal Spots**: Dark/black stains on mattress seams
- **Eggs/Shells**: Tiny (1mm) white eggs in crevices
- **Live Bugs**: Check seams, box springs, bed frames
- **Sweet Odor**: Musty, sweet smell in severe cases

## Why Professional Treatment is Critical

**DIY Failure Rate: Over 90%**

Bed bugs have evolved resistance to most retail pesticides. They hide in places sprays can't reach:
- Inside electrical outlets
- Behind baseboards and wallpaper
- Deep in furniture joints
- Inside electronics and books
- Throughout wall voids

**Professional Advantages**:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which treatment method is best?
Both work when properly applied:
- Chemical is budget-friendly but requires multiple visits
- Heat is faster but costs more upfront
- Integrated offers maximum effectiveness
We recommend based on your specific situation.

### Can I treat bed bugs myself?
Professional treatment is strongly recommended because:
- Bed bugs have pesticide resistance
- Hidden bugs survive DIY attempts
- Improper treatment spreads infestation
- Professional treatment includes warranty

### How long until bed bugs are gone?
- Chemical treatment: 4-6 weeks for complete elimination
- Heat treatment: Immediate kill, monitor for 2 weeks
- Both methods include follow-up to ensure success

### Do bed bugs transmit diseases?
No. While their bites are itchy and annoying, bed bugs are not known to transmit diseases. However, scratching can lead to secondary infections.

### Will bed bugs come back?
With proper treatment, bed bugs don't "come back" - any future activity is a new introduction. Our warranty covers re-treatment if needed, and we teach prevention strategies.
