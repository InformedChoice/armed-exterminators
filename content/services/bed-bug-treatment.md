# Bed Bug Treatment in Pasadena, CA

Waking up with mysterious bites? Finding blood spots on your sheets? Bed bugs are one of the most challenging pests to eliminate, requiring professional expertise. Armed Exterminators provides **proven bed bug elimination** using the latest treatment methods.

## Why Bed Bugs Spread in Pasadena

Bed bugs aren't a cleanliness issue—they're a mobility issue:
- **Travel hub** with hotels and vacation rentals
- **Dense housing** allows bugs to spread between units
- **College students** returning from dorms
- **Second-hand furniture** purchases
- **Public transportation** exposure

Bed bugs hide in:
- Mattress seams and box springs
- Bed frames and headboards
- Nightstands and dressers
- Electrical outlets near beds
- Carpet edges and curtain folds
- Picture frames and wall decorations

## Signs of Bed Bug Infestation

Early detection is crucial:
- **Bites** in lines or clusters on exposed skin
- **Blood stains** on sheets or pillowcases
- **Dark spots** (fecal stains) on mattresses
- **Reddish smears** on walls or furniture
- **Sweet musty odor** in severe infestations
- **Live bugs** (apple seed size and shape)
- **White eggs** (1mm, like tiny rice grains)

## Health & Lifestyle Impact

Bed bugs cause more than just bites:
- **Sleep deprivation** from anxiety
- **Skin infections** from scratching
- **Allergic reactions** in sensitive individuals
- **Social stigma** and isolation
- **Financial stress** from treatment costs
- **Mental health** impacts from ongoing stress

## Why Professional Treatment is Essential

DIY methods often fail because:
- Bed bugs hide in impossible-to-reach places
- They've developed pesticide resistance
- Missing even a few bugs restarts infestation
- Over-the-counter products don't kill eggs
- Improper treatment spreads bugs further

## Prevention Tips for Travelers

- **Inspect hotel rooms** before settling in
- **Keep luggage** on metal racks, not floors
- **Check secondhand items** before bringing home
- **Use protective covers** on mattresses
- **Vacuum regularly** and dispose of bag immediately
- **Reduce clutter** where bugs can hide
