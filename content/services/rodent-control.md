## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between rats and mice?
Rats are larger (6-10 inches body length) with thicker tails, while mice are smaller (2-4 inches) with thin tails. Rats are cautious, while mice are curious. Both require different control strategies.

### How quickly can you respond?
We offer same-day service throughout our service area. Most calls received by noon can be serviced the same day.

### Do you use poison?
We use integrated pest management, including traps and targeted baits when necessary. All materials are applied safely by licensed technicians to protect children, pets, and non-target wildlife.

### How much does rodent control cost?
Pricing varies by property size and infestation severity. Most treatments range from $295-$595, with free inspections available. Each city page has specific pricing for that area.
