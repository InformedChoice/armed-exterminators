### Mice

**House Mice (Mus musculus)**

## Signs of Rodent Activity

**Visual Evidence**:
- Droppings (rice-sized for rats, rice grain for mice)
- Gnaw marks on wood, wires, food packages
- Rub marks (greasy smudges) along walls
- Nesting materials (shredded paper, fabric)
- Actual sightings (usually indicates larger problem)

**Sounds**:

## Health Risks

Rodents pose serious health threats:

- **Leptospirosis**: Through contaminated water
- **Plague**: Extremely rare but possible via fleas
- **Rat-bite fever**: From bites or scratches
- **Allergens**: Droppings trigger asthma/allergies

- Targeted baiting where appropriate
- Exclusion for permanent solution
- Monitoring for early detection
- Prevention education

## Treatment Timeline

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between rats and mice?
Rats are larger (6-10 inches body) with thick tails, while mice are smaller (2-4 inches) with thin tails. Rats are cautious and harder to trap, while mice are curious but breed faster. Different strategies needed for each.

### How quickly can you respond?
We offer same-day service throughout our service area. Most calls received by noon can be serviced the same day. Emergency service available for severe infestations.

### Do you use poison?
We use integrated pest management, including traps and targeted baits when necessary. All materials are applied safely by licensed technicians in tamper-resistant stations to protect children, pets, and wildlife.

### Can I do this myself?
While DIY can catch a few rodents, professional service addresses the source: entry points, nesting sites, and conducive conditions. We solve the problem completely, not temporarily.

### How do I prevent rodents from returning?
Exclusion is key - seal all entry points. Maintain cleanliness, remove food sources, trim vegetation from structures, and consider ongoing monitoring service for peace of mind.
