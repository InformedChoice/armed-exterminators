# Rodent Control & Prevention in Los Angeles County

**Reclaim Your Home from Rats & Mice**

Few pests spread faster—or cause more hidden damage—than rodents. House mice can slip through dime-sized gaps, while roof and Norway rats scale vines, squeeze under tiles, and chew relentlessly. One female mouse may birth **30+ offspring in just six months**, turning a small problem into a full-blown infestation before you even notice the first scratching sound.

Rodents contaminate food, gnaw wiring, shred insulation, and carry diseases such as salmonellosis, hantavirus, and leptospirosis. Southern California's mild winters allow them to breed year-round, so the best time to act is *now*.

## How to Spot a Rodent Problem Early

- **Droppings** along baseboards, cabinet corners, or pantry shelves
- **Gnawed wires, cardboard, or plastic**—look for rough edges and shavings
- **Scratching or skittering noises** in walls, ceilings, or attic spaces, especially at night
- **Grease marks** where rodents run the same route along pipes or rafters
- **Musky odors** or nests made from shredded fabric, paper, or insulation

## The Armed Exterminators 5-Step Rodent Defense Plan

### 1. **Comprehensive Inspection**
Our licensed technicians survey interior and exterior areas—attics, crawl spaces, vents, and foundations—to identify entry points, nesting zones, and food sources.

### 2. **Precision Exclusion (Rodent Proofing)**
Every hole larger than a dime is sealed with gnaw-proof materials. We fortify vents, repair weather stripping, and install door sweeps to deny re-entry.

### 3. **Non-Toxic Trapping & Targeted Baiting**
Snap traps, multi-capture devices, and secure bait stations eliminate rodents quickly while keeping children, pets, and wildlife safe. Poison-free options are prioritized; baits are used only when necessary and always in tamper-resistant stations.

### 4. **Sanitation & Attic/Crawl-Space Cleanup**
We remove droppings, replace contaminated insulation, and disinfect affected areas—erasing scent trails that attract new rodents and lowering health risks.

### 5. **Follow-Up & Warranty Protection**
Rodent pressure can fluctuate with the seasons. We monitor traps, reinspect proofing work, and include a service warranty: if rodents return within the covered period, so do we—at no extra charge.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between roof rats and Norway rats?
Roof rats are sleek climbers that nest in attics and trees, while Norway rats are larger, ground-dwelling rodents that burrow and nest in basements or crawl spaces. Both require different control strategies.

### How quickly can rodents multiply?
A single pair of mice can produce 30-35 offspring in six months. Rats breed slightly slower but still produce 20+ young per pair annually. This exponential growth makes early intervention critical.

### Are rodent baits safe around pets and children?
When necessary, we use baits only in locked, tamper-resistant stations that prevent access by children and pets. However, we prioritize trapping and exclusion methods that avoid poisons entirely.

### How small of a hole can rodents fit through?
Mice can squeeze through openings as small as a dime (1/4 inch), while rats can fit through holes the size of a quarter (1 inch). That's why thorough exclusion work is essential.

### Do ultrasonic repellers work?
Studies show ultrasonic devices have limited effectiveness. Rodents quickly adapt to the sound, and the waves don't penetrate walls where rodents travel. Physical exclusion and population control work better.

### How often should I have rodent control service?
After initial elimination and exclusion, we recommend quarterly inspections to catch new activity early. Properties with ongoing pressure may benefit from monthly monitoring during peak seasons.
