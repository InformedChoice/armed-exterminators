# Mosquito Control in Los Angeles County

**Enjoy Your Yard—Without the Buzz**

Los Angeles summers were made for backyard barbecues, pool parties, and evening walks—not for swatting mosquitoes. Warm days, irrigated landscapes, and countless pockets of standing water allow these pests to flourish from May through September (and beyond in milder micro-climates). Female mosquitoes bite to obtain a blood meal, leaving itchy welts and, more importantly, putting families and pets at risk for **West Nile virus, Zika, dengue, and heartworm**.

## Why Mosquitoes Thrive Here

### Abundant Breeding Sites
Birdbaths, rain-filled planters, neglected pools, clogged gutters, and even a bottle cap of water can hatch hundreds of larvae.

### Year-Round Mild Climate
Day-biting species such as the **Asian tiger mosquito**, first detected locally in 2005, can complete multiple life cycles in a single warm season.

### Dense Vegetation & Shaded Patios
Mature trees and overgrown shrubs give adult mosquitoes the cool, humid hiding spots they crave between blood meals.

## Signs You Have a Problem

- An uptick in bites at dawn, dusk, or anytime you step outside
- High-pitched buzzing near ears, especially around patios or pool decks
- "Wrigglers" (larvae) in birdbaths, puddles, or saucers beneath potted plants
- Black-and-white striped mosquitoes resting on outdoor furniture (Asian tiger)

## The Armed Exterminators Mosquito Defense Program

### 1. **Expert Inspection**
Our licensed technicians walk every inch of your property—checking gutters, irrigation lines, drain boxes, and dense foliage—to pinpoint breeding and resting sites.

### 2. **Source Elimination & Environmental Fixes**
We dump or treat standing water, recommend grading or drainage improvements, and trim vegetation to reduce the cool, shaded harborage mosquitoes love.

### 3. **Eco-Friendly Larviciding**
Biorational larvicides target developing mosquitoes in water sources without harming fish, birds, or pollinators.

### 4. **Precision Adult Barrier Treatment**
Low-odor, low-toxicity micro-encapsulated products create a discreet barrier on foliage and shaded structures, knocking down adult populations fast.

### 5. **Ongoing Monitoring & Maintenance**
Depending on property size and pressure, we return every 21–30 days during peak season to refresh treatments and ensure continuous protection.

### 6. **Clear Communication & Education**
You receive a detailed service report after every visit plus simple, actionable tips to keep your yard mosquito-free between treatments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is mosquito treatment safe for my family and pets?
Yes. We use EPA-registered products specifically labeled for residential mosquito control. Our micro-encapsulated formulations are applied to foliage where mosquitoes rest, not areas where children and pets play. We'll provide specific re-entry guidelines based on your property.

### How long does mosquito treatment last?
Our barrier treatments typically provide 21-30 days of protection. During peak mosquito season (May-October), we recommend monthly service for continuous protection.

### Can you treat my pool for mosquitoes?
We don't treat swimming pools directly, but we'll inspect pool equipment, covers, and surrounding areas where water collects. Properly maintained pools with circulating, chlorinated water don't breed mosquitoes.

### What about natural/organic mosquito control?
We offer botanical and biorational options including garlic-based repellents, essential oil treatments, and BTI (a naturally occurring bacteria) for larvae. These eco-friendly alternatives are perfect for organic gardens and sensitive areas.

### Do I need to be home during treatment?
No. We can treat the exterior while you're away. We'll leave a detailed service report and any recommendations for reducing mosquito breeding sites.

### What's the difference between fogging and your treatment?
Traditional fogging provides temporary relief but dissipates quickly. Our micro-encapsulated barrier treatments bond to foliage and continue working for weeks, providing longer-lasting protection with less environmental impact.
