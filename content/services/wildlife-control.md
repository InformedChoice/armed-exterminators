## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is wildlife removal really necessary?
Yes. Wildlife in structures cause significant damage, health risks, and fire hazards from chewed wires. Professional removal ensures safety and prevents costly damage.

### Why can't I just trap animals myself?
California law requires proper licensing for wildlife trapping. Improper handling risks injury, disease exposure, and leaving babies to die in structures. Professionals ensure humane, legal removal.

### What happens to trapped animals?
When legal, animals are relocated to suitable habitats away from structures. Some species cannot be relocated by law and are humanely euthanized. We follow all California Fish & Wildlife regulations.

### How do you handle babies?
Baby animals require special timing and techniques. We hand-remove babies when possible, reunite with mothers, or work with wildlife rehabilitators. Never seal babies inside.

### Can you guarantee animals won't return?
With proper exclusion work, the same animals cannot return. However, new animals may try to enter if attractants remain. Our prevention service maintains long-term protection.
