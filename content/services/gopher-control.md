# Pocket Gopher Control in Los Angeles County

**Protect Your Landscape—Above and Below Ground**

Pocket gophers are expert diggers that tunnel relentlessly under lawns, gardens, and even driveways. One animal can push up **1–3 fresh soil mounds every day**, severing roots, flooding sprinkler lines, and undermining patios and foundations. Because these rodents breed year-round in Southern California, a small problem can quickly escalate into a costly, property-wide headache.

## Why Pocket Gophers Are a Serious Issue

### Landscape Destruction
Roots, bulbs, turf, and ornamental plants become lunch, leaving wilted foliage and dead patches on the surface.

### Structural & Utility Damage
Burrows can break irrigation pipes, chew through drip lines, and compromise retaining walls or concrete slabs.

### Rapid Re-Infestation
Remove one gopher and another soon moves in; vacant tunnel systems are prime real estate.

### Hidden Activity
Gophers spend nearly all their time underground, so by the time you spot mounds, extensive networks may already exist.

## Telltale Signs You Need Help

- Fan- or crescent-shaped mounds of fresh, powdery soil
- Sudden plant wilting or missing seedlings as roots are clipped from below
- Spongy ground or hollow sounds under walkways when stepped on
- Pets or wildlife fixated on one area of the yard

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if I have gophers or moles?
Gopher mounds are fan-shaped with the hole plugged, while mole mounds are circular with the hole in the center. Gophers eat plant roots and create visible damage to lawns and gardens, while moles eat insects and create raised tunnels.

### How quickly can gophers damage my lawn?
A single gopher can create 1-3 new mounds daily and destroy extensive root systems within days. During peak activity (spring and fall), damage accelerates as gophers expand territories for mating.

### Are gopher treatments safe for pets?
Yes, when properly applied by professionals. We use targeted trapping and careful fumigation techniques that minimize risk to pets. We'll provide specific safety instructions based on your treatment plan.

### Why do gophers keep coming back?
Empty tunnel systems attract new gophers from neighboring properties. That's why we include follow-up visits and recommend exclusion barriers for long-term protection.

### Can I just flood the tunnels?
Flooding rarely works and can damage your lawn further. Gophers have extensive tunnel systems with multiple exits, and water can undermine foundations or cause erosion.

### What plants do gophers avoid?
Gophers typically avoid plants with strong scents like lavender, rosemary, and oleander. However, hungry gophers will eat almost anything, so exclusion barriers are more reliable than plant selection.
