## Understanding Flea Infestations

### Where Fleas Come From
- **Pets**: Dogs and cats are primary hosts
- **Wildlife**: Opossums, raccoons, and feral cats
- **Previous tenants**: Dormant pupae can emerge months later
- **Visitors**: Friends' pets can introduce fleas
- **Yard**: Shaded, moist areas breed fleas

### The Flea Life Cycle
Effective treatment must address all four stages:
1. **Eggs** (50% of population) - Fall off pets into environment
2. **Larvae** (35%) - Hide in carpets and cracks
3. **Pupae** (10%) - Protected cocoons, can stay dormant
4. **Adults** (5%) - The biters you see

### Why DIY Fails
- Foggers don't reach hidden larvae
- Sprays miss pupae in cocoons
- Pet-only treatment ignores environment
- Single treatment doesn't break cycle
- Re-infestation occurs within weeks

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long until fleas are gone?
Adult fleas die within hours, but complete elimination takes 2-4 weeks as remaining eggs and pupae develop. This is why follow-up treatment is crucial.

### Do I need to treat my yard?
If pets go outside or you have wildlife visitors, yard treatment is recommended. Outdoor treatment prevents re-infestation and speeds elimination.

### What about my pets?
Pets must be treated by a veterinarian on the same day as home treatment. We coordinate with your vet for best results. Ongoing prevention is essential.

### Is treatment safe for my family?
Yes. We use products specifically designed for flea control with excellent safety profiles. We provide clear instructions for treatment day and re-entry times.
