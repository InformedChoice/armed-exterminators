## Understanding Flea Infestations

### The Flea Life Cycle - Why Complete Treatment Matters
Effective flea control must address all four life stages:

1. **Eggs (50% of infestation)**
   - Females lay 40-50 eggs daily
   - Fall off pets into carpets, bedding, furniture
   - Hatch in 2-14 days depending on conditions
   - Nearly invisible to naked eye

2. **Larvae (35% of infestation)**
   - Worm-like, avoid light
   - Feed on flea feces and organic debris
   - Hide deep in carpet fibers and cracks
   - Develop for 5-20 days before pupating

3. **Pupae (10% of infestation)**
   - Protected by sticky cocoon
   - Can remain dormant for months
   - Resistant to pesticides
   - Emerge when they sense hosts

4. **Adults (5% of infestation)**
   - The visible biters
   - Must feed within days
   - Can jump 150x their body length
   - Live 2-3 months on hosts

### Where Fleas Come From
- **Pets**: Dogs and cats are primary hosts (even indoor cats)
- **Wildlife**: Opossums, raccoons, stray cats in yard
- **Previous Residents**: Dormant pupae can emerge months later
- **Visitors**: Friends' pets can introduce fleas
- **Yard**: Shaded, moist areas become breeding grounds

### Signs of Flea Infestation
- Pets scratching excessively
- Small red bites, often around ankles
- Black specks (flea dirt) in pet bedding
- Seeing fleas jump on white socks
- Tiny white eggs in carpet fibers
- Pets developing "hot spots" or hair loss

## Why DIY Flea Treatment Fails

**Common Mistakes**:
- **Flea Bombs/Foggers**: Don't penetrate where larvae hide
- **Sprays Only**: Miss pupae protected in cocoons
- **Treating Pets Only**: Ignores 95% of fleas in environment
- **One-Time Treatment**: Doesn't account for life cycle
- **Wrong Products**: Many fleas resistant to retail pesticides

**Result**: Re-infestation within 2-3 weeks

## Our Professional Flea Elimination Process

### 1. **Comprehensive Inspection**
- Identify flea hot spots and breeding areas
- Assess infestation severity
- Check for wildlife access points
- Evaluate moisture issues
- Create customized treatment plan

### 2. **Indoor Flea Treatment**
**Living Areas**:
- Apply Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) to break life cycle
- Treat all carpeted areas with specialized equipment
- Focus on pet resting areas and travel paths
- Treat upholstered furniture and cushions
- Crack and crevice treatment for larvae

**Bedrooms**:
- Careful treatment around and under beds
- Closet floors where pets may hide
- Area rugs and carpeted areas
- Baseboards and floor cracks

**Hard Surfaces**:
- Mop-on treatment for tile and wood floors
- Under appliances and furniture
- Around pet feeding areas

### 3. **Outdoor Flea Treatment**
**Yard Treatment**:
- Identify and treat shaded, moist areas
- Under decks, porches, and structures
- Along fence lines where wildlife travel
- Garden areas with ground cover
- Pet resting areas outdoors

**Perimeter Defense**:
- Create barrier around home
- Treat entry points
- Address crawl spaces if needed

### 4. **Critical Follow-Up Service**
**Why Follow-Up is Essential**:
- Pupae emerging after initial treatment
- Ensure complete life cycle interruption
- Address any missed areas
- Prevent re-infestation

**Timing**: 14-21 days after initial treatment

### 5. **Prevention Program**
- Wildlife exclusion recommendations
- Moisture control advice
- Ongoing pet prevention coordination

## Preparation for Flea Treatment

### Before We Arrive
**Essential Steps**:
1. Vacuum all carpets, rugs, and furniture thoroughly
2. Dispose of vacuum bag in outside trash
3. Wash all pet bedding in hot water
4. Pick up items from floors
5. Cover or remove pet food/water bowls
6. Cover fish tanks and turn off pumps
7. Coordinate pet flea treatment with vet

### Day of Treatment
- Plan to be away for 3-4 hours
- Take pets with you or arrange care
- Leave indoor areas accessible
- Ensure yard is clear for outdoor treatment

### After Treatment
**First 24 Hours**:
- Wait for specified re-entry time
- Keep pets off treated areas until dry
- Ventilate home upon return

**First 2 Weeks**:
- Vacuum daily (stimulates pupae emergence)
- Dispose of vacuum bags immediately
- May see some fleas (normal - they'll die)
- Keep pets on flea prevention

## Pet Coordination

**Critical**: Pets MUST be treated on the same day as your home

**Veterinary Options**:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long until all fleas are gone?
Adult fleas die within hours of treatment. Complete elimination takes 2-4 weeks as remaining eggs and pupae develop and contact the treatment. This is why follow-up service is included.

### Why am I still seeing fleas after treatment?
This is normal and expected. Pupae protected in cocoons emerge over 2-3 weeks. They'll die upon contact with treated surfaces. Daily vacuuming speeds this process.

### Do I need to treat my yard?
If pets go outside or you have wildlife visitors, yard treatment is essential. Up to 80% of the flea population can be outdoors. We include yard treatment in our comprehensive service.

### Is the treatment safe for my baby/pets?
Yes, when applied according to label directions. We use products specifically designed for homes with children and pets. Clear re-entry times ensure safety.

### What if I don't have pets?
Previous residents' pets, wildlife, or visiting animals can leave fleas behind. Dormant pupae can emerge months later when they sense new hosts. Treatment is the same regardless of current pet ownership.
