# Flea Treatment in Pasadena, CA

Pets scratching constantly? Feeling bites around your ankles? Flea infestations can quickly spiral out of control, making your home unbearable. Armed Exterminators provides **comprehensive flea elimination** that breaks the breeding cycle for lasting relief.

## Why Pasadena Homes Get Fleas

Our warm climate creates year-round flea problems:
- **No killing freeze** allows continuous breeding
- **Wildlife** like opossums and raccoons spread fleas
- **Outdoor cats** bring fleas to neighborhoods
- **Dog parks** and trails expose pets
- **Warm winters** mean no seasonal die-off

Fleas complete their life cycle in:
- Pet bedding and favorite resting spots
- Carpets and rugs throughout home
- Upholstered furniture and cushions
- Cracks in hardwood floors
- Shaded areas in yards

## Our 4-Stage Flea Elimination Process

### 1. Comprehensive Property Inspection
We assess all flea sources:
- Indoor infestation levels
- Pet resting areas
- Yard and outdoor spaces
- Wildlife access points
- Previous treatment history

### 2. Interior Flea Treatment
Breaking the indoor cycle:
- **Pre-treatment vacuuming** to stimulate emergence
- **Insect growth regulators** prevent larvae development
- **Residual treatments** for carpets and floors
- **Furniture treatment** where pets rest
- **Crack and crevice** applications

### 3. Exterior Flea Control
Stopping outdoor breeding:
- **Yard treatment** focusing on shaded areas
- **Under deck/porch** applications
- **Pet pathway** treatments
- **Wildlife deterrence** recommendations
- **Moisture reduction** advice

### 4. Follow-Up & Prevention
Ensuring complete elimination:
- Return visit in 2-3 weeks
- Re-treatment if needed
- Pet treatment coordination
- Ongoing prevention plan
- Warranty protection

## Understanding the Flea Life Cycle

Effective treatment targets all stages:
- **Eggs** (50% of infestation) - Fall into carpets
- **Larvae** (35%) - Hide deep in fibers
- **Pupae** (10%) - Protected in cocoons
- **Adults** (5%) - The visible biters

Missing any stage means re-infestation within weeks.

## Integrated Flea Control Approach

Success requires coordination:
1. **Pet treatment** by veterinarian
2. **Professional home treatment** by Armed
3. **Thorough cleaning** by homeowner
4. **Yard treatment** if needed
5. **Wildlife exclusion** when necessary

- **Wash pet bedding** in hot water
- **Pick up items** from floors
- **Treat pets** on same day
- **Plan to leave** for 2-4 hours
- **Follow-up vacuuming** daily for 2 weeks

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are fleas still biting after treatment?
Flea pupae can remain dormant for months, emerging when they sense vibration or heat. This is why follow-up treatment and continued vacuuming are essential for complete control.

### Is treatment safe for my baby/pets?
Yes. We use EPA-registered products specifically labeled for flea control. We'll provide detailed safety instructions and re-entry times based on your family's needs.

### Do I need to treat my yard too?
If pets spend time outdoors or you have wildlife visitors, yard treatment is recommended. Fleas develop in shaded, moist areas where pets rest outside.
