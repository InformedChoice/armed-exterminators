## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I be worried about all spiders?
Most spiders are harmless and actually beneficial. However, black widows pose real danger, especially to children and elderly. We focus on eliminating dangerous species while managing overall populations.

### How do you treat without harming my pets?
Our targeted applications focus on spider hiding spots—not open areas where pets play. We use products specifically labeled for spider control at the lowest effective rates.

### Why do spiders keep coming back?
Spiders follow their food source—other insects. Our treatment addresses both spiders and the insects they eat, providing longer-lasting control than spraying spiders alone.
