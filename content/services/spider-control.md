# Professional Spider Control Services

Worried about spiders in your home? Armed Exterminators provides expert spider control throughout the San Gabriel Valley and Greater Los Angeles areas, specializing in black widow removal and comprehensive spider management. With technicians in every major city and 28 years of experience, we deliver fast, safe spider elimination.

## Spider Species We Control

### Black Widow Spiders
**Highly Venomous** - Southern California's most dangerous spider. Identified by:
- Shiny black body with red hourglass marking
- Hide in dark, undisturbed areas (garages, sheds, meter boxes)
- Neurotoxic venom requires immediate medical attention
- Female bites can be fatal to children and elderly

### Brown Widow Spiders
**Moderately Venomous** - Increasingly common in urban areas:
- Tan to brown with orange hourglass marking
- Found under patio furniture, in planters, and playground equipment
- Less venomous than black widows but still medically significant
- More likely to be encountered than black widows

### Brown Recluse Spiders
**Note**: True brown recluses are NOT native to California. Most "recluse" sightings are actually:
- Desert recluses (found in remote desert areas)
- Harmless brown spiders misidentified
- We provide accurate identification to ease concerns

### Wolf Spiders
**Non-Venomous** - Large, fast-moving hunters:
- Can grow up to 2 inches across
- Don't build webs, actively hunt prey
- Intimidating but harmless to humans
- Often enter homes in fall seeking warmth

### Common House Spiders
**Harmless** - Various species including:
- Cellar spiders (daddy long-legs)
- Cobweb spiders
- Jumping spiders
- Sheet web spiders

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are all spiders dangerous?
No. Of the dozens of spider species in Southern California, only black widows and brown widows pose medical risks. Most spiders are harmless and even beneficial for controlling other pests.

### How long does spider treatment last?
Our treatments provide 60-90 days of protection. Regular quarterly service maintains a spider-free environment year-round.

### Is spider treatment safe for pets and children?
Yes. We use EPA-registered products applied by licensed technicians in targeted applications. Products are applied in cracks and crevices where spiders hide, away from family activity areas.

### Why do I have so many spiders?
Spiders indicate abundant prey (other insects). Outdoor lighting, moisture, and clutter all attract the insects that spiders eat. Our treatment addresses both spiders and their food source.

### Can you guarantee black widow elimination?
Yes. Our treatment specifically targets black widow hiding spots and includes a 90-day warranty. If you see black widows after treatment, we return at no charge.

### Should I be worried about brown recluse spiders?
True brown recluses don't live in Southern California. Most "recluse" concerns are misidentified harmless spiders. We provide accurate identification to ease your concerns.
