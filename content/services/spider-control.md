## Spider Species We Control

### Black Widow Spiders
Venomous spiders with neurotoxic bites. Hide in dark, undisturbed areas like garages, sheds, and meter boxes. Require immediate professional removal.

### Brown Widow Spiders
Less venomous cousins of black widows. More common in urban areas, found under patio furniture and in planters.

### Wolf Spiders
Large, fast-moving ground hunters. Non-venomous but intimidating. Common in gardens and occasionally enter homes.

### House Spiders
Various species that create messy webs indoors. While harmless, they indicate other insect problems.

### Garden Spiders
Large orb weavers that create impressive webs outdoors. Generally beneficial but can become numerous.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are all spiders dangerous?
No. Most spiders are harmless and even beneficial. However, black widows and brown widows have medically significant venom. Our service focuses on eliminating dangerous species while managing overall populations.

### How long does spider treatment last?
Our treatments typically provide 60-90 days of protection. Regular service prevents re-infestation and maintains a spider-free environment.

### Will treatment harm beneficial spiders in my garden?
Our targeted approach focuses on structures and living areas, not garden spaces where beneficial spiders help control pests.

### What should I do if I find black widows?
Don't attempt removal yourself. Call us immediately for safe, professional removal. We offer same-day service for dangerous spider situations.
