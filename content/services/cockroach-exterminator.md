## Why Pasadena Gets Cockroaches

Pasadena's environment supports several roach species:
- **Warm climate** allows year-round breeding
- **Older neighborhoods** with mature sewer systems
- **Dense housing** enables roaches to spread between units
- **Commercial corridors** provide food sources and harborage

Common species in Pasadena include:
- **German cockroaches** - Kitchen and bathroom invaders
- **American cockroaches** - Large "sewer roaches" from drains
- **Oriental cockroaches** - Dark, moisture-loving "water bugs"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How did roaches get in my clean home?
Roaches can enter through tiny gaps, in grocery bags, or from neighboring units. They need very little to survive—even clean homes can have infestations if there's moisture and small food particles.

### Are your treatments safe for my family?
Absolutely. We use EPA-registered products applied by licensed professionals. Our targeted application methods keep treatments in areas where roaches travel, away from family living spaces.

### Why shouldn't I just use bug bombs?
Foggers drive roaches deeper into walls without eliminating them. They also spread pesticides throughout living areas. Our precision treatments target roaches where they hide while keeping your home safe.
