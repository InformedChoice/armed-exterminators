The most common indoor species. Small, tan roaches that multiply rapidly in kitchens and bathrooms. Require professional treatment for complete elimination.

### American Cockroaches
Large reddish-brown "sewer roaches" that enter through drains and pipes. Common in basements and commercial buildings.

### Oriental Cockroaches
Dark "water bugs" that thrive in cool, damp areas. Often found in basements, crawl spaces, and around floor drains.

### Brown-Banded Cockroaches
Smaller roaches that prefer warm, dry locations. Hide in furniture, electronics, and upper cabinets.
