# Professional Cockroach Extermination Services

Found roaches in your home or business? Armed Exterminators provides expert cockroach elimination throughout the San Gabriel Valley and Greater Los Angeles areas. With 28 years of experience and technicians in every major city, we deliver fast, discreet roach control exactly where you need it.

## Cockroach Species We Eliminate

### German Cockroaches
The most common indoor species. Small, tan roaches that multiply rapidly in kitchens and bathrooms. They can produce up to 400 offspring per year, making professional treatment essential for complete elimination.

### American Cockroaches
Large reddish-brown "sewer roaches" or "palmetto bugs" that can grow up to 2 inches long. They enter through drains, pipes, and foundation cracks. Common in basements, sewers, and commercial buildings.

### Oriental Cockroaches
Dark "water bugs" that thrive in cool, damp areas. Often found in basements, crawl spaces, and around floor drains. They're slower moving but extremely hardy and difficult to eliminate.

### Brown-Banded Cockroaches
Smaller roaches that prefer warm, dry locations. They hide in furniture, electronics, and upper cabinets. Unlike other species, they don't need much moisture to survive.

## Health Risks of Roach Infestations

Cockroaches are more than just disturbing - they're dangerous:

- **Disease Transmission**: Carry 33 types of bacteria including Salmonella and E. coli
- **Asthma Triggers**: Major cause of asthma in children, especially in urban areas
- **Food Contamination**: Spread pathogens to every surface they touch

- **Property Damage**: Damage books, wallpaper, electronics, and fabrics

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can you eliminate roaches?
Most infestations show dramatic improvement within 48 hours. Complete elimination typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on severity and species.

### Is treatment safe for my family and pets?
Yes. We use EPA-registered products applied by licensed technicians in targeted applications. All products are applied according to label directions with safety as our priority.

### Why do roaches keep coming back?
DIY treatments rarely reach hidden egg cases and breeding sites. German roaches can hide in spaces as thin as a dime. Professional treatment targets all life stages and reaches deep harborage areas.

### Do you treat apartments?
Yes. We work with both tenants and property managers. We can treat individual units or entire buildings, and provide documentation for property management.

### What should I do to prepare for treatment?
We'll provide a detailed preparation sheet, but generally:
- Clear kitchen counters and empty lower cabinets
- Pull appliances away from walls if possible
- Remove items from under sinks
- Pick up pet food and water dishes
