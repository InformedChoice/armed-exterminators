# Professional Moth Control Services

Few household pests cause as much frustration as pantry or clothes moths. Indian meal moth larvae burrow into cereals, grains, nuts, pet food and even chocolate, while clothes moth larvae chew through wool, silk and other natural fabrics. Left unchecked, these tiny invaders contaminate food, ruin garments and can reproduce year-round inside Southern California homes.

## Types of Moths We Eliminate

### Indian Meal Moths (Pantry Moths)
The most common stored food pest in homes:
- **Larvae**: Cream-colored with brown heads, spin silky webbing in food
- **Adults**: 1/2 inch wingspan, coppery-red outer wings
- **Target**: Grains, cereals, nuts, dried fruit, pet food, birdseed, chocolate
- **Damage**: Contaminate entire pantries, create webbing and waste

### Clothes Moths
Two species attack natural fabrics:
- **Webbing Clothes Moths**: Most common, create silky tubes on fabrics
- **Casemaking Clothes Moths**: Larvae drag portable cases as they feed
- **Target**: Wool, silk, cashmere, fur, feathers, felt, leather
- **Damage**: Irregular holes in garments, carpets, upholstery

### Mediterranean Flour Moths
Similar to Indian meal moths:
- **Appearance**: Pale gray with wavy black lines on wings
- **Target**: Flour, cereals, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit
- **Behavior**: Strong fliers, often seen zigzagging near lights

## Why Moths Are a Problem

### Food Loss & Contamination
- Just one infested package can spoil an entire pantry shelf
- Larvae leave behind webbing, feces, and cast skins
- Contaminated food must be discarded for health reasons
- Can spread quickly between stored products

### Hidden Damage
- Larvae feed out of sight inside packages and fabrics
- First sign is often ruined food or holes in clothing
- By the time adults are seen, infestation is established
- Can go unnoticed for months in stored items

### Continuous Breeding
- Indoor temperatures allow multiple generations per year
- Female moths lay 100-400 eggs directly on food sources
- Complete life cycle in as little as 30 days
- Year-round breeding makes early intervention critical

## Common Warning Signs

### Pantry Moths
- Worm-like larvae or silky webbing in grains, flour, cereal or pet food
- Sticky clumps or powdery residue where larvae have tunneled
- Adult moths fluttering near kitchen lights or pantry areas
- Small moths walking on pantry shelves rather than flying
- Cocoons in corners of cabinets or food packages

### Clothes Moths
- Tiny holes or threadbare patches on wool, cashmere, or silk
- Silky tubes or cases on fabric surfaces
- Moths flying from closets when disturbed
- Larvae or cocoons in closet corners or under furniture
- Damage concentrated in dark, undisturbed areas

## Prevention Tips You Can Start Today

### For Pantry Moths
- Move grains, rice, nuts and pet food into sealed glass or plastic containers
- Inspect bulk foods, birdseed and spices before storing
- Vacuum pantry shelves regularly and dispose of bag immediately
- Use oldest products first (FIFO - First In, First Out)
- Clean up spills immediately and don't leave pet food out

### For Clothes Moths
- Store susceptible garments in airtight bags or containers
- Clean items before storing (moths prefer soiled fabrics)
- Use cedar blocks or lavender sachets as deterrents
- Vacuum closet floors and baseboards regularly
- Place infested items in freezer (0°F) for 72 hours

### General Prevention
- Reduce humidity with dehumidifiers or improved ventilation
- Seal cracks and crevices where moths can hide
- Install tight-fitting screens on windows and vents
- Regular cleaning and inspection of storage areas
- Donate unused dry goods and clothing

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How did moths get in my sealed packages?
Moths often enter homes in already-infested products from stores. Eggs and tiny larvae can be present in seemingly sealed packages. They can also chew through plastic bags and cardboard.

### Are moth control treatments toxic?
No. We use eco-friendly, low-odor treatments safe for families and pets. Pheromone traps contain no pesticides, and growth regulators specifically target moth development without affecting mammals.

### How long does moth elimination take?
Complete elimination typically takes 30-45 days to break the full life cycle. You'll see immediate reduction in adult moths, with full control as remaining eggs and larvae are eliminated.

### Should I throw away all my food?
Not necessarily. Our technicians will help identify what's infested and what's safe. Unopened cans and jars are typically fine. We'll guide you through the inspection process.

### Can moths damage my home's structure?
No. Unlike termites or carpenter ants, moths only damage food products and natural fabrics. They don't harm wood, drywall, or home structures.

### How can I prevent future moth problems?
Proper storage is key. Use airtight containers for susceptible foods and garments. Regular cleaning, inspection, and humidity control create an environment moths avoid.
