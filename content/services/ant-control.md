## Common Ant Problems We Solve

### Argentine Ants
The most common species in Southern California, forming massive super-colonies that can span entire neighborhoods. They're attracted to moisture and sweet foods.

### Carpenter Ants
Large black ants that damage wood structures. Unlike termites, they don't eat wood but excavate it to build nests, causing structural damage.

### Odorous House Ants
Small brown ants that emit a rotten coconut smell when crushed. They love sweets and are common in kitchens and bathrooms.

### Pharaoh Ants
Tiny yellow ants that can spread bacteria and contaminate food. They're particularly problematic in restaurants and healthcare facilities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do ants keep coming back after DIY treatment?
Store-bought sprays often scatter colonies without eliminating the queen. Professional treatments use non-repellent products that ants carry back to the colony, ensuring complete elimination.

### How quickly can you respond?
We offer same-day service throughout our service area. Most calls received by noon can be serviced the same day.

### Is ant treatment safe for pets and children?
Yes. We use EPA-registered products applied by licensed technicians using targeted methods that keep treatments away from areas where family and pets frequent.

### What's included in your ant control service?
Our service includes inspection, identification, interior and exterior treatment, exclusion recommendations, and a 90-day warranty with free re-service if needed.
