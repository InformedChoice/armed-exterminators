# Ant Exterminator Pasadena, CA

Is your kitchen overrun with ants? Finding trails along your countertops? Pasadena homeowners face persistent ant invasions, especially during our hot, dry summers. Armed Exterminators delivers **proven ant elimination** that stops infestations at the source.

## Why Pasadena Gets Ants

Pasadena's unique conditions create perfect ant habitat:
- **Summer heat** drives Argentine ants indoors seeking water
- **Drought conditions** intensify invasions as ants search for moisture
- **Mature landscaping** provides nesting sites near foundations
- **Irrigation systems** create moisture that attracts colonies

The notorious **Argentine ant** dominates Pasadena, forming super-colonies that can span entire neighborhoods. These persistent invaders require professional treatment to eliminate completely.

## Our 4-Step Ant Elimination Process

### 1. Species Identification & Inspection
Different ants require different approaches:
- **Argentine ants** - Most common, form massive colonies
- **Carpenter ants** - Damage wood structures
- **Odorous house ants** - Emit foul smell when crushed
- **Pharaoh ants** - Contaminate food, spread bacteria

### 2. Colony Location & Trail Mapping
We trace ant highways to find:
- Hidden nests in walls, under slabs, or in landscaping
- Entry points around windows, doors, and utility lines
- Moisture sources attracting colonies
- Food sources sustaining infestations

### 3. Targeted Treatment Application
Our integrated approach includes:
- **Non-repellent baits** that ants carry back to the queen
- **Perimeter treatments** creating protective barriers
- **Crack and crevice applications** in key areas
- **Gel baits** in sensitive areas near food or pets

### 4. Prevention & Monitoring
Long-term ant control requires:
- Sealing entry points with caulk
- Fixing water leaks and moisture issues
- Removing food attractants
- Regular monitoring for new activity
