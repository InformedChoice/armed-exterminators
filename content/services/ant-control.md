# Professional Ant Control Services

Dealing with an ant invasion? Armed Exterminators provides expert ant control throughout the San Gabriel Valley and Greater Los Angeles areas. With licensed technicians in every major city and 28 years of experience, we deliver fast, effective ant elimination exactly where you need it.

## Common Ant Problems We Solve

### Argentine Ants
The most common species in Southern California, forming massive super-colonies that can span entire neighborhoods. They're attracted to moisture and sweet foods, making kitchens and bathrooms prime targets.

### Carpenter Ants
Large black ants that damage wood structures. Unlike termites, they don't eat wood but excavate it to build nests, potentially causing significant structural damage over time.

### Odorous House Ants
Small brown ants that emit a rotten coconut smell when crushed. They love sweets and are common in kitchens, bathrooms, and areas with moisture issues.

### Pharaoh Ants
Tiny yellow ants that can spread bacteria and contaminate food. They're particularly problematic in restaurants, hospitals, and healthcare facilities where sanitation is critical.

## Our Proven Ant Control Process

### 1. **Thorough Inspection & Identification**
- Identify the exact ant species (critical for effective treatment)
- Locate entry points, trails, and nesting sites
- Assess environmental factors attracting ants
- Determine the extent of the infestation

### 2. **Strategic Treatment Plan**
- Use species-specific baits that ants carry back to colonies
- Apply non-repellent treatments that don't scatter colonies
- Target both indoor and outdoor populations
- Focus on eliminating queens for permanent results

### 3. **Exclusion & Prevention**
- Seal cracks, gaps, and entry points
- Address moisture issues that attract ants
- Remove food sources and improve sanitation
- Trim vegetation touching structures

### 4. **Follow-Up & Monitoring**
- Schedule follow-up visits to ensure complete elimination
- Monitor bait stations and treatment effectiveness
- Adjust strategies based on results
- Provide ongoing prevention guidance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do ants keep coming back after DIY treatment?
Store-bought sprays are repellents that scatter colonies without eliminating queens. Professional treatments use non-repellent products that ants unknowingly carry back to the colony, ensuring complete elimination including the queen.

### How quickly can you respond?
We offer same-day service throughout our service area. Most calls received by noon can be serviced the same day. Emergency service is available for severe infestations.

### Is ant treatment safe for pets and children?
Yes. We use EPA-registered products applied by licensed technicians using targeted methods that keep treatments away from areas where family and pets frequent. All products are applied according to label specifications for maximum safety.

### What's included in your ant control service?
Our comprehensive service includes:
- Full property inspection
- Species identification
- Interior and exterior treatment
- Crack and crevice application
- Exclusion recommendations
- 90-day warranty with free re-service if needed

### Do I need to leave during treatment?
No. Our methods allow you to remain home during service. We use targeted applications in areas where ants travel, avoiding broad surface sprays.
