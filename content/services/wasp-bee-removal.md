## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can you respond?
We offer same-day service for most calls, with emergency response available for immediate dangers. Evening service available when wasps are less active.

### Is it safe to stay home during treatment?
Yes, but remain indoors during service. We'll advise when it's safe to resume normal activities. Most treatments take 30-60 minutes.

### Can you save the bees?
We partner with beekeepers to relocate honey bee swarms when possible. Established hives in structures usually require removal due to honey damage risks.

### What attracts stinging insects to my property?
Sweet foods, bright flowers, perfumes, and moisture attract them. Wasps also seek protein sources. Old nests, wood structures, and cavities provide nesting sites.

### Will they come back after removal?
Proper removal includes eliminating pheromone traces that attract new colonies. Our prevention service identifies and addresses attractants to reduce future problems.

### What if someone is allergic?
Alert us immediately about allergies. We prioritize allergic households and can provide emergency response. Always have medical supplies ready and know your emergency plan.
