## Frequently Asked Questions

### How dangerous are wasps versus bees?
Wasps can sting multiple times and are generally more aggressive. Bees sting once and die, so only sting when threatened. Both can trigger severe allergic reactions.

### Can you save the bees?
Yes! We work with beekeepers to relocate honey bee colonies when structurally feasible. Established hives in walls may require removal to prevent damage.

### What attracts stinging insects?
Sweet foods, bright colors, perfumes, and flowering plants attract them. Wasps also seek protein sources and moisture. Regular maintenance reduces attraction.

### When is removal most urgent?
Nests near high-traffic areas, allergic individuals, or aggressive species require immediate attention. Don't wait if safety is compromised.
