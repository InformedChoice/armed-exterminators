## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are black widows common in Arcadia?
Yes, especially around pool equipment, outdoor structures, and storage areas. Arcadia's warm climate and numerous outbuildings create ideal black widow habitat. Regular treatment is essential.

### How do you treat spiders around pools and outdoor kitchens?
We use targeted applications that won't affect pool chemistry or contaminate cooking areas. Treatments focus on spider hiding spots while avoiding surfaces people contact.

### Is spider control safe for horses?
Yes, we use specialized methods for equestrian properties. Treatments are applied away from areas horses access, focusing on structures and storage rather than pastures or stables.

### Why do I have so many spiders with all my outdoor lights?
Landscape and security lighting attracts insects, which attract spiders. We recommend switching to yellow "bug lights" or repositioning fixtures away from structures.

### How often should Arcadia estates be treated for spiders?
Most Arcadia properties benefit from quarterly service due to large outdoor areas and multiple structures. Black widow-prone areas may need more frequent attention during summer.
