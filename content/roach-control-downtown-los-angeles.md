# Cockroach Control in Downtown Los Angeles

**German cockroaches** are the #1 pest problem in Downtown LA's high-density living and dining spaces. From **Arts District lofts** to **Historic Core restaurants**, these resilient insects spread rapidly through shared walls, utility lines, and food service areas. **Armed Exterminators** specializes in **DTLA cockroach elimination** with discrete, same-day service.

## Why Downtown LA Has Cockroach Problems

* **High building density** - roaches spread between units easily
* **24/7 food service** - constant food sources in restaurants and cafés  
* **Old infrastructure** - utility tunnels and shared walls provide hiding spots
