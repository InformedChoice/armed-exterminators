## Frequently Asked Questions

### How are Altadena's rat problems different from other cities?
Altadena's mountain interface means continuous rat migration from wilderness areas. Unlike urban rats, these populations include pack rats and have access to natural food sources.

### Do you use different methods near the canyons?
Yes, we use elevated bait stations and specialized exclusion techniques to protect non-target wildlife while effectively controlling rats. All methods comply with wilderness interface regulations.

### Why are roof rats so bad in Altadena?
The combination of mature trees, elevation, and older homes creates perfect roof rat habitat. They travel from the mountains through tree canopies directly into attics.

### How do you handle rats on horse properties?
We use feed-safe methods, secure all baits away from livestock areas, and focus on exclusion around feed storage. Our technicians are experienced with equestrian properties.

### Can rats from the mountains carry diseases?
Yes, wild rats can carry hantavirus, plague, and other diseases. This is why professional removal is essential - we use safe methods that minimize disease exposure risk.
