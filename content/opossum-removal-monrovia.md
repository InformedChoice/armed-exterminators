## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I do if I see an opossum in my yard?
Don't approach or corner it. Opossums are typically non-aggressive and will leave on their own at night. If it appears sick, stays visible during day, or is denning on your property, call for professional removal.

### Will opossums attack my cats or dogs?
Opossums prefer to avoid confrontation, but will defend themselves if attacked. They may compete for pet food. Keep pets indoors at night and supervise outdoor time to prevent encounters.

### How do I know if opossums are living under my house?
Listen for hissing, clicking, or movement sounds at night. Look for entry holes, tracks, droppings, or a musky odor. You might also notice insulation pulled down or disturbed items in crawl spaces.

### Are opossums beneficial at all?
Yes, they eat thousands of ticks, reducing Lyme disease risk. They also consume snails, slugs, and rodents. However, when they invade homes or threaten pets, removal becomes necessary.

### What's the difference between opossum and possum?
In North America, we have Virginia opossums (often called possums colloquially). True possums are different animals found in Australia. Both spellings refer to the same animal here.
