## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you treat just my apartment, or does the whole building need treatment?
While we can treat individual units, roaches often travel between apartments through shared walls and plumbing. We recommend coordinating with neighbors or property management for best results.

### How do roaches spread in Pasadena apartment buildings?
German roaches (most common in Pasadena) spread through plumbing chases, electrical conduits, and shared walls. They hitchhike in grocery bags, boxes, and used furniture.

### Is your roach treatment safe for my pets and children?
Yes, we use targeted gel baits and dust applications placed in cracks and crevices where roaches hide but children and pets can't reach. All products are EPA-registered and applied by licensed technicians.

### How long does it take to eliminate a roach infestation?
Most infestations show dramatic improvement within 7-14 days. Severe or building-wide problems may require 2-3 treatments over 30-45 days for complete elimination.

### Why are German roaches so common in Pasadena?
Pasadena's dense housing, numerous restaurants, and older buildings create ideal conditions. German roaches thrive in warm kitchens and bathrooms with access to water.
