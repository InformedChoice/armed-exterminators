# Mouse Control in Pasadena, CA

Finding mouse droppings in your kitchen drawers? Hearing tiny feet scurrying in your walls at night? Pasadena's dense urban environment and older buildings create perfect conditions for house mouse infestations. Armed Exterminators provides **fast, effective mouse elimination** that stops these disease-carrying pests immediately.

## Why Pasadena Has Mouse Problems

Pasadena's urban landscape supports mouse populations:
- **Historic buildings** with countless entry points
- **Dense housing near colleges** allows easy migration
- **Restaurants and cafes** provide food sources
- **Mild winters** enable year-round breeding
- **Construction activity** displaces existing colonies

## House Mice vs. Rats: Know the Difference

### House Mouse Characteristics
- **Size**: 2-4 inches (body), tail same length
- **Droppings**: Rice grain sized, pointed ends

### Why Mice Are Worse Than Rats

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How are mice getting into my Pasadena apartment?
Mice can squeeze through openings as small as 1/4 inch. Common entry points in Pasadena's older buildings include gaps under doors, openings around pipes, and cracks in foundations. They often travel between units through wall voids.

### Is it mice or rats in my walls?
Mouse sounds are light scratching and quick scurrying, usually at night. Their droppings are rice-sized with pointed ends. Rats make heavier thumping sounds and leave larger, capsule-shaped droppings.

### Why do I suddenly have mice?
Pasadena's construction boom often displaces existing mouse colonies. Also, seasonal changes, nearby restaurant closures, or new neighbors can drive mice to seek new homes.

### How long does mouse control take?
Most infestations show significant improvement within 3-7 days. Complete elimination typically occurs within 2 weeks, though severe infestations may require follow-up service.

### Are mice dangerous?
Yes. Mice can carry hantavirus, salmonella, and other diseases. Their droppings and urine contaminate food surfaces. They also gnaw electrical wires, creating fire hazards.
