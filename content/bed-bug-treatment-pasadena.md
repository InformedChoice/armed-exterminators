## Frequently Asked Questions

### How did I get bed bugs?
Bed bugs hitchhike on luggage, used furniture, clothing, and even electronics. In Pasadena, common sources include hotel stays, vintage furniture from Old Town shops, or migration from neighboring apartments.

### Do I have to throw away my furniture?
No! Most furniture can be successfully treated. We only recommend disposal for severely damaged items. Our treatments penetrate deep into furniture to eliminate all bed bugs.

### How long does treatment take?
Chemical treatments take 2-4 hours per unit with 2-3 visits needed. Heat treatments take 6-8 hours but usually require just one visit. You can typically return the same day.

### Will bed bugs spread to neighbors?
Yes, bed bugs can travel between units through wall voids, electrical outlets, and under doors. We recommend notifying property management so adjacent units can be inspected.

### Is treatment safe for pets and children?
Yes, when properly applied. We use EPA-registered products and follow all safety protocols. For heat treatments, pets and people must leave during service but can return immediately after.
