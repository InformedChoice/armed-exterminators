San Marino's manicured landscapes, extensive irrigation systems, and luxury outdoor amenities create perfect conditions for persistent ant colonies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you protect expensive landscaping during ant treatment?
We use landscape-safe products and application methods specifically designed for estate properties. Our technicians are trained to work around specimen plants and water features.

### Can you provide discrete service for our estate?
Absolutely. We offer unmarked vehicles, can schedule during specified windows, and coordinate with your house manager or staff for seamless service.

### Why do ants keep returning despite our gardener's efforts?
Professional landscapers maintain aesthetics but aren't pest control experts. Ant colonies require specialized treatment that landscape maintenance can't provide.

### How do you treat ants around our outdoor kitchen and pool?
We use food-safe products near cooking areas and pool-safe treatments that won't affect water chemistry. All applications follow EPA guidelines for these sensitive areas.

### Do you coordinate with our other service providers?
Yes, we regularly coordinate with landscape crews, pool services, and property managers to ensure comprehensive ant control without service conflicts.
