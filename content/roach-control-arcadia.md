## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are roaches common in upscale Arcadia homes?
Yes, even luxury homes can have roaches. Arcadia's extensive landscaping, irrigation systems, and outdoor living spaces create ideal conditions. It's not about cleanliness—it's about environment.

### How do you treat roaches near pools and outdoor kitchens?
We use specialized products safe for outdoor entertaining areas. Treatments focus on harborage sites while avoiding food prep surfaces and pool equipment. All products are EPA-approved for these uses.

### Do horse properties need different roach treatments?
Yes, horse properties require careful product selection and placement. We avoid areas where horses may contact treatments and focus on feed rooms, tack rooms, and structural perimeters.

### Can you provide discrete service for our estate?
Absolutely. We offer unmarked vehicles and can schedule service during specified windows. Many Arcadia clients prefer early morning or when they're away.

### Why are we seeing large roaches from outside?
American roaches ("palmetto bugs") live in mulch and landscaping but enter homes seeking water. They're common in Arcadia's lush yards, especially near automatic irrigation systems.
