# Wildlife & Pest Control in **Temple City, California**

Dealing with roof rats in your mature fruit trees? Skunks burrowing under your raised foundation? Armed Exterminators provides expert wildlife removal and pest control services throughout Temple City. Our licensed technicians understand the unique challenges of foothill properties and dense tree canopies that make 91780 a haven for urban wildlife.

## Common Temple City Wildlife & Pest Problems We Solve

Temple City's combination of mature landscaping, foothill proximity, and older homes creates specific pest challenges:

### **Roof Rats** - Major Problem in Mature Trees
Temple City's abundant fruit trees and decades-old oak/pine canopy provide perfect habitat for roof rats. These agile climbers access homes via:
- Overhanging branches touching rooflines
- Power lines running between trees
- Dense ivy and vegetation on walls

### **Skunks & Opossums** - Under Raised Foundations
Many Temple City homes feature raised foundations that attract:
- **Skunks** seeking denning sites (city requires permits for removal)
- **Opossums** nesting in crawl spaces
- Both species drawn to fallen fruit and pet food

### **Raccoons** - Increasing Foothill Activity
Temple City regularly issues alerts about raccoon sightings, especially near:
- Foothill streets and canyon interfaces
- Properties with koi ponds or water features
- Unsecured garbage areas

### **Bats** - Rabies Risk
Temple City has documented cases of bats testing positive for rabies. Professional removal is critical for:
- Attic colonies
- Eave and soffit dwellers
- Any bat found inside living spaces

### **Mosquitoes** - West Nile Concerns
West Nile-positive mosquito samples were detected in Temple City (October 2024). We help eliminate breeding sites in:
- Clogged gutters
- Standing water
- Overgrown vegetation

*(We do not provide mosquito treatment services but offer prevention consulting)*
