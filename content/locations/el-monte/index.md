# Wildlife & Rodent Control in **El Monte, California**

Norway rats thriving in your alleyways? Gophers destroying your lawn? Armed Exterminators provides comprehensive wildlife removal and pest control throughout El Monte. With the challenges of river proximity, dense commercial areas, and established neighborhoods, we understand what makes 91731-91735 unique for pest management.

## Major El Monte Wildlife & Pest Challenges

El Monte's location between the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers, combined with dense urban development, creates specific pest problems:

### **Norway Rats & Roof Rats** - Thriving Near Waterways
El Monte's proximity to flood-control channels creates ideal rat habitat:
- **Norway rats** in sewers and ground burrows
- **Roof rats** in dense alleyways and food businesses
- Both species spreading from rivers into neighborhoods
- Heavy infestations near commercial food sources

### **Gophers & Ground Squirrels** - Lawn Destroyers
Wide residential lots in El Monte suffer from:
- **Pocket gophers** creating extensive tunnel systems
- **Ground squirrels** destroying lawns and gardens
- Both attracted to irrigated landscapes
- Damage to foundations and utilities

### **Raccoons & Skunks** - Urban Adapted
Regular sightings throughout El Monte, including:
- School campuses and parks
- Properties with unsecured trash
- Backyards with fruit trees
- Areas near the rivers

### **Mosquitoes** - West Nile Risk
West Nile virus detected in El Monte mosquito samples (August 20, 2024):
- Breeding in flood-control channels
- Standing water in residential areas
- Vector-control wetlands nearby
- Year-round concern due to climate
