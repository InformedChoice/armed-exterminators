# Pest Control in **Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA)**

The urban heart of Los Angeles, from the **Arts District** and **Historic Core** to **South Park** and the **Fashion District**, faces unique pest pressures: rats in century-old utility tunnels, roaches in restaurant corridors, and bed bugs hitch-hiking through dense high-rise living. **Armed Exterminators** brings discreet, same-day service to loft owners, property managers, and businesses that demand a pest-free environment.
