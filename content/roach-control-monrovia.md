## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are American roaches so common in Monrovia?
Monrovia's foothill location means American roaches (palmetto bugs) naturally live in canyon areas. They enter homes seeking water during dry periods or warmth during winter.

### How do canyon properties differ for roach control?
Canyon-adjacent homes need stronger perimeter barriers and more frequent treatments due to continuous outdoor roach pressure. We also focus on moisture management from fog and springs.

### Can roaches survive Monrovia's occasional cold snaps?
Yes, roaches seek warm shelter in homes during cold weather. This is why foothill homes often see increased indoor activity during winter months.

### What attracts roaches to Monrovia yards?
Fallen fruit, pet food, compost bins, and thick ground cover all attract roaches. The morning fog and canyon moisture make these attractants even more appealing to roaches.

### Are the new Turkestan roaches in Monrovia?
Yes, we're seeing increasing Turkestan roach populations in Monrovia, especially in lower foothill areas. They're outdoor roaches but enter homes at night seeking food.
