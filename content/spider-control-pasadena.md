## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are black widows common in Pasadena homes?
Yes, especially in garages, basements, and sheds. Pasadena's older homes with detached garages and storage areas provide ideal black widow habitat. Regular treatment is essential.

### When are spiders most active in Pasadena?
Spider activity peaks in late summer and early fall when they're mating and seeking winter shelter. However, Pasadena's mild climate means year-round activity, especially in protected areas.

### How do you treat spiders in historic Pasadena homes?
We use methods that protect original wood and plaster while effectively eliminating spiders. This includes targeted dust applications and careful perimeter treatments that won't damage historic materials.

### Why do I have so many spiders near the Arroyo?
Properties near the Arroyo Seco see more spider diversity due to the natural habitat. The combination of native vegetation, water sources, and insect populations creates ideal spider conditions.

### Can you just remove webs without killing spiders?
We offer web removal services, but without treating the spiders, webs typically return within days. We recommend treatment combined with web removal for lasting results.
