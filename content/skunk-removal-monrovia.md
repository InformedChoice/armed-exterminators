# Skunk Removal in Monrovia, CA

Skunks denning under your deck? Worried about pets getting sprayed? Monrovia's foothill location and residential gardens attract skunks year-round. Armed Exterminators provides **safe, humane skunk removal** that protects your family and property.

## Why Monrovia Has Skunk Problems

Monrovia's unique environment creates ideal skunk habitat:
- **Canyon proximity** provides natural dens and travel corridors
- **Irrigated lawns** attract grubs, a favorite skunk food
- **Dense landscaping** offers daytime hiding spots
- **Pet food** left outdoors provides easy meals
- **Fruit trees** drop food sources throughout the year

## Signs of Skunk Activity

### Visual Signs
- **Cone-shaped holes** in lawns from grub hunting
- **Burrow entrances** under structures (4-6 inches wide)
- **Tracks** showing five toes with claw marks
- **Droppings** similar to cat feces with insect parts

### Behavioral Signs
- **Nocturnal activity** - rustling sounds after dark
- **Pet agitation** - dogs barking at night
- **Garbage raids** - overturned cans and scattered trash
- **That unmistakable smell** - even without direct spraying

### 2. Strategic Removal

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I do if my pet gets sprayed?
Don't bring them inside! Mix 1 quart hydrogen peroxide, 1/4 cup baking soda, and 1 teaspoon dish soap. Apply immediately, avoiding eyes. Rinse thoroughly. Call us for professional odor removal if needed.

### When are skunks most active?
Skunks are nocturnal, most active from dusk to dawn. In Monrovia, they're especially active February through October, with peak activity during mating season (February-March).

### Can skunks climb fences?
Skunks are poor climbers but excellent diggers. They'll go under rather than over barriers. Bury fence edges 12 inches deep with an L-shaped footer to prevent digging.
