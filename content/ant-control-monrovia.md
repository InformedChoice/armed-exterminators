# Ant Control in Monrovia, CA

Are ants streaming in from your canyon-facing walls? Finding trails throughout your historic home? Monrovia's foothill location and mature neighborhoods create unique ant challenges, especially during our hot, dry summers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are ants worse in foothill areas of Monrovia?
The elevation creates unique moisture patterns from morning fog and canyon breezes. This, combined with wilderness ant populations migrating toward water sources, intensifies ant pressure on foothill homes.

### Do canyon-adjacent homes need different treatments?
Yes, we create barrier treatments along canyon-facing property lines and pay special attention to retaining walls and slopes where ants travel from wilderness areas into Monrovia neighborhoods.

### When is ant season worst in Monrovia?
Late spring through early fall, when canyon areas dry out and ants seek moisture in irrigated yards. Morning fog also creates temporary moisture that attracts ants to foothill homes.

### How do you treat historic Monrovia homes?
We use careful application methods that protect original woodwork and plaster while effectively eliminating ants. Our technicians are trained to work with 1920s-era construction common in Old Town.

### Are treatments safe near Monrovia Canyon Park?
Absolutely. We use eco-friendly methods near wilderness interfaces and ensure our treatments don't harm beneficial insects or wildlife that may visit from nearby natural areas.
