## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I do if I see a skunk in my yard?
Don't approach or corner it. Move slowly and quietly indoors. Most skunks are just passing through at night. If it's denning on your property or acting strangely during the day, call for professional removal.

### How far can skunks spray?
Skunks can accurately spray up to 10 feet and the mist can travel 20 feet. They can spray multiple times. This is why professional equipment and expertise are essential for safe removal.

### What attracts skunks to Pasadena properties?
Lawn grubs are the #1 attractant, followed by pet food, accessible garbage, and water sources. Skunks also seek shelter under decks, sheds, and in crawl spaces for denning.

### Can skunks climb fences?
Skunks are poor climbers but excellent diggers. They'll go under rather than over barriers. Effective fencing must extend underground with an L-shaped footer to prevent digging.

### What's the best time to remove skunks?
Fall through early winter is ideal - after babies are independent but before deep denning. However, we provide emergency removal year-round when skunks pose immediate risks.
