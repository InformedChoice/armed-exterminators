# Opossum Removal in Arcadia, CA

Hearing loud hissing noises at night? Finding your pet food disappearing? Arcadia's tree-lined neighborhoods and proximity to the Angeles National Forest make it a prime habitat for Virginia opossums. Armed Exterminators provides **safe, humane opossum removal** that protects your property and family.

## Why Arcadia Has Opossum Problems

Arcadia's unique environment attracts opossums year-round:
- **Mature landscaping** provides daytime hiding spots and travel routes
- **Proximity to wilderness areas** creates natural wildlife corridors
- **Abundant water sources** from irrigation and the Santa Anita Wash
- **Pet food left outdoors** offers easy meals for nocturnal visitors
- **Fruit trees** throughout neighborhoods provide seasonal food

## Signs of Opossum Activity

### Visual Signs
- **Overturned garbage cans** with contents scattered
- **Pet food bowls** mysteriously emptied overnight
- **Tracks** showing five toes with visible claw marks
- **Droppings** similar to cat feces but often containing berries or insects
- **Disturbed mulch** or dig marks around gardens

### Behavioral Signs
- **Loud hissing or growling** sounds at night
- **Pets acting agitated** after dark
- **Strong musky odor** near decks or crawl spaces
- **"Playing dead"** if cornered during daylight

## Health & Safety Concerns

### Disease Risks
While opossums rarely carry rabies due to their low body temperature, they can harbor:
- Leptospirosis through urine
- Salmonella in droppings
- Various parasites including fleas and ticks
- Toxoplasmosis (less common)

### Defensive Behavior
- Opossums will hiss, drool, and show teeth when threatened
- "Playing possum" (catatonic state) when extremely frightened
- Can bite if cornered or handled
- Generally docile but unpredictable when protecting young

## Arcadia-Specific Opossum Issues

### Common Problem Areas
- **Peacock District** - mature trees and older homes with crawl spaces

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Spring**: Mothers with babies seeking safe den sites
- **Summer**: Young opossums learning to forage independently
- **Fall**: Increased activity as they fatten for winter

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will an opossum attack me or my pets?
Opossums are generally docile and prefer to flee or "play dead" rather than fight. However, they will defend themselves if cornered. Keep pets indoors at night to avoid confrontations, as cats and dogs may provoke defensive responses.

### Do opossums carry rabies?
It's extremely rare due to their low body temperature (94-97°F), which makes it difficult for the rabies virus to survive. However, they can carry other diseases and parasites, so avoid direct contact and call professionals for removal.

### How can I tell if an opossum is living under my house?
Signs include loud hissing or clicking sounds at night, a distinctive musky odor, disappearing pet food, and disturbed insulation or stored items. You might also see tracks near crawl space openings.

### What's the best way to trap an opossum?
Professional-grade humane cage traps with proper bait (fruits, pet food, or sardines) are most effective. However, California law requires proper permits for trapping and relocating wildlife. We handle all legal requirements and ensure humane treatment.

### Why do they "play dead"?
This involuntary response (thanatosis) occurs when opossums are extremely frightened. They become catatonic, emit a foul odor, and appear dead for minutes to hours. Never assume a "dead" opossum is actually deceased - call professionals for safe removal.
