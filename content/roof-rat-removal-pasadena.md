# Roof Rat Removal in Pasadena, CA

Hearing scurrying in your attic at night? Finding spindle-shaped droppings in your home? Pasadena's historic neighborhoods with mature trees and older homes create perfect conditions for roof rats (also called black rats or tree rats). Armed Exterminators specializes in **complete roof rat elimination** with proven methods that keep them from returning.

## Why Pasadena Has Roof Rat Problems

Pasadena's environment is ideal for roof rat infestations:
- **Historic homes** with accessible attics and original construction gaps
- **Mature tree canopy** provides highways between properties
- **Mediterranean climate** allows year-round breeding
- **Abundant food sources** from fruit trees and bird feeders
- **Dense neighborhoods** enable rats to spread house to house

## Signs of Roof Rat Infestation

### Visual Evidence
- **Spindle-shaped droppings** about 1/2 inch long with pointed ends
- **Gnaw marks** on wood, wires, and stored items
- **Grease marks** along walls from their oily fur
- **Nests** made from shredded insulation, paper, or fabric
- **Actual sightings** of sleek, dark rats with long tails

### Audio Clues

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are they called "roof rats"?
They earned this name because they prefer elevated areas - trees, power lines, and especially roofs and attics. Unlike Norway rats that burrow, roof rats are excellent climbers and live above ground, often entering homes through the roofline.

### How do I know if I have roof rats vs. mice?
Roof rats are much larger (6-8 inches body length plus a 7-9 inch tail), leave bigger droppings (1/2 inch), and make louder noises. Mice droppings are rice-sized and their sounds are lighter. In Pasadena attics, it's usually roof rats.

### Can I get rid of roof rats myself?
While DIY traps might catch a few, roof rats are cautious and breed rapidly (up to 40 offspring per year per female). Complete elimination requires professional knowledge of behavior, proper bait placement, and thorough exclusion work.

### Are roof rats dangerous?
Yes - they spread diseases through droppings and urine, contaminate food, and their gnawing creates fire hazards. A UCLA study found 34% of "unexplained" house fires were rodent-related. Professional removal protects your health and property.

### How quickly do rats multiply?
Extremely fast - females can have 4-6 litters per year with 5-10 pups each. A pair of rats can become 1,250 in one year under ideal conditions. This is why swift, complete removal is essential.
