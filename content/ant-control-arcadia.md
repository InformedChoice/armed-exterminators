## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do ants keep coming back to my Arcadia home?
Arcadia's extensive irrigation systems create ideal conditions for Argentine ant super-colonies that can span entire neighborhoods. Professional treatment targets the whole colony system, not just visible ants.

### Are your treatments safe for horses?
Yes, we specialize in horse-safe pest control methods. We use targeted applications that keep treatments away from stables, paddocks, and grazing areas while effectively eliminating ant colonies.

### How long before my ant problem is solved?
You'll see significant reduction within 24-48 hours. Complete colony elimination typically occurs within 5-7 days as worker ants share the treatment with queens throughout the super-colony.

### Do Arcadia's large lots require different treatment?
Yes, Arcadia's estate properties often need more extensive perimeter treatments and multiple bait placements. We customize our approach based on property size, landscaping, and irrigation patterns.

### Why are ants worse after it rains?
Rain floods underground nests, driving ants inside. Arcadia's clay soil doesn't absorb water quickly, making this problem worse. We recommend preventive treatment before rainy season.
